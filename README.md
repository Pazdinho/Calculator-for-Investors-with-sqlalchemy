# Calculator for Investors with sqlalchemy

This is the *Calculator for Investors with sqlalchemy* project I made myself.


<p>In this project I'll create a small program that helps investors make a fundamental analysis based on the company's reports and estimate the company's performance. With this calculator, you can choose the best company in the industry and decide whether to buy its shares or not.</p><br/><br/>

<p><b>Learning outcomes:</b> Database managing with sqlalchemy library available in Python</p>
